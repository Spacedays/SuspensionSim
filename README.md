# SuspensionSim
Matlab 2D and 3D Simulations of a Formula SAE-E vehicle suspension for MAE-490/491 senior design. 
The two analysis scripts (main_anaysis.m and Forces_In_Members.mlx) use values for the rear suspension of the car, but if the values are updated appropriately there's no reason they could not be used to model front suspensions as well.

I had originally hoped to combine the 2D and 3D models into a single script, but this was not a high enough priority to complete mid-design, so it is not complete.
